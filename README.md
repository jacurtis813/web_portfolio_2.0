## Development Journey

---

### Phase 1: The Start
1. **Setup Project Directory**
   - Created project folder: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and `README.md`.  

2. **Created Custom ASCII Art Logo**
   - Designed ‚ÄúJAC TechKnowledge-y‚Äù logo in Notepad.  
   - Added as part of the UI using a `<pre>` block for proper formatting.  

3. **HTML: Initial Framework**
   - Built base layout for the terminal UI container (`#terminalWrapper`).  
   - Added `#panelWrapper` with three panel boxes:
     - **Badges Earned**
     - **ASCII Art Logo**
     - **Level-Up Meter**

4. **CSS: Initial Styling**
   - Applied dark theme background (`#121212`) and neon green text (`#00ff90`).  
   - Added glowing borders and box shadows for retro terminal feel.  
   - Styled panel boxes for consistent sizing and alignment.  

5. **Terminal Header UI**
   - Added fake macOS-style window buttons (üî¥ üü° üü¢).  
   - Inserted a terminal title: `jac_terminal_portfolio`.  
   - Styled header and buttons to match the terminal aesthetic.  

6. **Developed Popup Viewer**
   - **HTML**: Created popup structure to mimic opening a file or document.  
   - **CSS**: Styled the popup for ‚Äúnano editor‚Äù and browser preview modes.  
   - **JS**: Added basic functions to show/hide popup when clicking items.

### Phase 2: Interactions
1. **‚ÄúClear Terminal‚Äù Button**
   - **HTML**: Added button below the terminal container.  
   - **CSS**: Styled button to match terminal theme with hover/focus effects.  
   - **JS**: Added event listener to clear session and reload terminal:  
     ```js
     clearButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
       sessionStorage.clear();
       location.reload();
     });
     ```

2. **Directory Structure & Navigation**
   - **JS**: Created `directoryStructure` object to store folders and files.  
   - Added clickable folders:
     ```
     about_me/  cv_skills/  projects/  resources/  web_portfolio/
     ```
   - Used `bindDirectoryClicks()` to handle folder clicks dynamically.  

3. **Populated Folder Content**
   - **JS**: Added text files and project logs for each folder (e.g., `about_me.txt`, `vm_config.txt`).  
   - Dynamically loaded content into popup viewer when clicked.  

4. **Interactive Typing Effect**
   - Wrote `typeLines()` and `typeCharacters()` functions to simulate typing animation.  
   - Added blinking cursor animation using CSS:
     ```css
     .cursor {
       animation: blink 1s steps(2, start) infinite;
     }
     ```

5. **Boot-Up Sequence**
   - **JS**: Built `playBootSequence()` function to display animated startup messages.  
   - Used `sessionStorage` to skip boot on page refresh.

### Phase 3: Refinement & Polish
1. **CSS Enhancements**
   - Improved responsiveness for smaller screens.  
   - Fine-tuned colors, spacing, and font sizes for consistency.

     - OS comparisons  
     - CMD/PowerShell cheat sheets  
     - Linux commands  
   - Designed badges (üíª Terminal Titan, üêß Love of Linux, üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Windows Wizard).  
   - Added level-up meters showing skill progress.  

3. **Popup Viewer Polish**
